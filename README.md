# Project Synopsis

# Background

Most often, we get into a situation when we want to cook something delicious, however, we are short on ingredients at our home. It also creates a lot of confusion about what to cook with the available ingredients. Further, we might not have accessibility to more ingredients from the nearby market due to various reasons like non-availability or specifically the unprecedented times as Covid which has resulted in shutdowns. Finally, we are bound at home to make the best possible dish from leftover ingredients. Our project aims to make a user aware of the various dishes which can be cooked from the available set of ingredients being input by a user.

# Motivation

This project is a great platform for people to learn and expand their knowledge in the field of cooking. Moreover, it will help in exploring and spreading the taste of one region worldwide. It will also bring innovation to the art of cooking. Our motivation is not only restricted to these merits but also includes more information about nutrition for respective recipes. Nutrition and health being the most important aspects of one's life are also one of the most neglected areas. This project will also ensure that a user is aware of his/her food intake value and thus plan to explore and make healthier meals.
